# Project Proposal - Proposition de Projet

This week you will produce a proposal in PDF format. 

To facilitate report writing as a group, you can use a shared writing software such as [Google docs](https://docs.google.com) or [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).

You can draw inspiration from the following example: [proposal_template.pdf](proposal_template.pdf).

### Submit

1. Upload your report on your group's Github repository. 
2. Then, submit the link on Chagrade, on [6. Proposal](https://chagrade.lri.fr/homework/submit/2/21/1/). You need to submit the link only once for the group. Ask the project leader to submit (or anybody else can do it if he/she is not available).
