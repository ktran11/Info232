# Project Proposal - Proposition de Projet

### Strict deadline: March 15

This week you will produce a proposal in PDF format. 

To facilitate report writing as a group, you can use a shared writing software such as [Google docs](https://docs.google.com) or [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).

You can draw inspiration from the following example: [proposal_template.pdf](proposal_template.pdf).

Here is an example of [successful proposal](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y2hhbGVhcm4ub3JnfHNhY2xheXxneDozZWY1NGIxNzM0YjVlNWFk).

### Grading

* **Originality (/5)**: try to add **your own ideas**, to be **creative**. Examples: You find an interesting plot? Include it. You discovered a processing that may work very well/bad? Talk about it. You tried or want to try a unique model? Describe it.

* **Clarity/presentation (/5)**: is your report easy to read? Does it include figures, titles, bibliography? Is the text formatting good?

* **Soundness (/10)**: does your report make sense? The information provided should be accurate and interesting. Did you provide results? Explanations? Analysis? Describe, with your own words, the models and methods you want to study in the future. Your descriptions must be accurate.

### Submit

1. Upload your report on your group's Github repository. 
2. Then, submit the link on Chagrade, on [6. Proposal](https://chagrade.lri.fr/homework/submit/2/21/1/). You need to submit the link only once for the group. Ask the project leader to submit (or anybody else can do it if he/she is not available).

#### PS. Gaiasavers and Medi-chal groups

Remember that you can study the raw data (images instead of pre-processed features) for a more interesting project!
