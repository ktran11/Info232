Instructions for TP11
========

## Fetch Materials for TP11 from Upstream
This week fetch new materials from the original repo. To get new materials for TP11, you need to open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd ~/projects/info232
git remote add upstream https://github.com/zhengying-liu/info232.git
git fetch upstream master
git checkout upstream/master TP11
```
and you'll find a new folder `TP11` in your directory, which contains the materials we need for today.

This is not a graded TP. Just use this notebook to generate graphs for your videos and reports.
